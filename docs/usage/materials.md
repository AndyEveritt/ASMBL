# Material Guidance

Material | Usage Advised | Cut In | Feed Rate (mm/m) | End Mill Speed (krpm) | Comments
-------- | ------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | --------
Spoolworks MatX (ASA) | Yes | [See below](#cut-in) | ~750 | 10 | Cuts well, produces a nice finish. Recommended material choice
PEEK | Yes | [See below](#cut-in) | ~750 | 10 | Performs beautifully
Spoolworks PLA | No | [See below](#cut-in) | ~750 | 10 | Melts too much when cutting, causes the cutter to gunk up and strands of plastic to be left on/around part.
XT-CF20 | No | [See below](#cut-in) | ~750 | 10 | Melts and causes accelerated wear to end mill
Luvocom 3F PET CF 9870 BK | No | [See below](#cut-in) | ~750 | 10 | Cuts well, but wears out end mills very very quickly
Spoolworks EDGE (PET) | No | [See below](#cut-in) | ~750 | 10 | Tends to gum up the end mill, not as bad as PLA

## Cut-in

The standard cut-in amounts for all materials (unless otherwise stated) is:
- Top Surfaces:
  - Step down 0.3 mm
  - Step over 0.5 mm
- Vertical Faces:
  - Step down 0.6 mm (2 layers)
  - Step over 0.2 mm
